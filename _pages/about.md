I am a third-year PhD student at the National Center for Text Mining (<a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/">NaCTeM</a>) at the University of Manchester, advised by Prof.<a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/sophia.ananiadou.html">Sophia Ananiadou</a> and Prof.<a href="https://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/intro/">Jun'ichi Tsujii</a>.
In June 2020, I received my Master degree from <a href="https://english.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. Prior to this, I received my BS degree from <a href="https://en.nankai.edu.cn">Nankai University</a> in June 2017.

My current research interests include Natural Language Processing (especially BioNLP), Affective Computing, Mental Health Application and so on. üéâ
